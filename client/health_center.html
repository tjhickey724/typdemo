		The Psychological Counseling Center was founded in 1952 to provide counseling to Brandeis undergraduates and graduate students. Staffed by psychologists, social workers, supervised doctoral interns and psychiatrists, the center aims to facilitate the developmental transition from late adolescence to young adulthood while providing diagnostic and treatment services.
	</p>

	<p>	
		Approximately 20 percent of Brandeis students make use of Counseling Center services each academic year. They present a wide range of concerns, including academic problems, relationship and roommate problems, family problems, substance use/abuse, sexuality, depression, anxiety and psychosis. The majority of students are seen in individual counseling, with a focus on collaboration between student and counselor on how counseling might be most helpful. The Counseling Center also offers couples counseling and issue-specific counseling groups that vary yearly according to the needs of the student body. Both short-term and long-term counseling are available. A Counseling Center staff member is available for urgent situations throughout the year. After normal hours and on weekends, the on-call clinician can be reached through the answering service (617-431-4814) for consultation in emergency situations.
	</p>

	<p>							
		The staff of the Counseling Center also consult with concerned faculty and staff about how to best respond to students' emotional or developmental needs. We invite questions or discussions about responding to routine student issues or unusual or more serious situations.
